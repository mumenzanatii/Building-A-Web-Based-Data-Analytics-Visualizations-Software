## ðŸ§°Â Tools used in this project:


- Django(Python) Web Framework
- HTML
- Tailwind (Utility CSS Framework)
- Node.js
- Chartjs

***ðŸ’¡ For me, it was about exploring new types of projects (yes I was bored a little :( ) and doing some stuff out of the pocket to push myself toward new things. Surprisingly, I found myself enjoying what Iâ€™m achieving despite the fact that the tools I used were a little bit like an intruder to my career which is Data Analysis, but the idea of the web itself was like a kind of mediator to me.***
